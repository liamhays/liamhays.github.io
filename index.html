      Hi! I'm Liam Hays, a high school student in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, and you've found my website. It's mostly devoted to
      projects I've created or worked on, and I'm adding some
      blog-like content.

    <h1>Writing/Documentation</h1>
    <p>
      I have written some basic Sega Game Gear programming tutorials
      using the SMSlib C library,
      available <a href="https://liamhays.github.io/c_gg_lessons/contents/contents.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I
      wrote <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/game-gear-power-docs">a
      complete circuit analysis</a> of the two switching regulators
      inside the Sega Game Gear handheld console in LaTeX. It remains
      the most complete documentation of these regulators and the
      power system inside this console in existence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 2020, I wrote
      a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xJqassetCrPjHy9RSIzAp5_YHReIM33seBNZfSYKVo/edit?usp=sharing">brief
      technical description</a> (public Google Doc) of a combined DVD
      player/karaoke machine for the Texas Instruments Electronics
      Online Challenge. The DVD player belonged to a friend, and I
      wrote the document using only pictures of the device's
      internals. My writeup was voted into the top ten out of hundreds
      of submissions.

    <h1>Contributions</h1>

    <p>
      I am the first person in the open-source community to
      investigate the integrated RISC-V microcontroller contained in
      the Rockchip RK3566 SoC, as used in the
      Pine64 <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Quartz64">Quartz64</a>, <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab2">PineTab2</a>,
      and
      the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote">PineNote</a>. <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/rk3566-mcu">My
      research</a> is ongoing and will help provide features to Pine64
      devices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have contributed multiple commits to
	the <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/flipperzero-firmware">official
	firmware repository</a> for
	the <a href="https://flipperzero.one">Flipper Zero</a> hacking
	multitool.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2022,
	I <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/sphero-ble">reverse
	engineered and documented</a> the Bluetooth LE UART protocol
	used by
	the <a href="https://sphero.com/collections/coding-robots/products/sphero-mini">Sphero
	Mini educational robot</a>.

    <h1>Technical Projects</h1>

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/lamda"><h3>LAMDA</h3></a>
    <img src="lamda/top_view.jpg" style="display: block; width: 30%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      LAMDA is a 2-channel 100 kSPS 12-bit data sampling system built
      with an STM32F405 ARM microcontroller board. LAMDA captures
      multiple seconds of data at a time and saves it to an SD card,
      synchronizing samples against a pulse-per-second signal from a
      GPS unit. LAMDA is programmed with the STM32Cube framework.
    </p>


    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/alum"><h3>alum</h3></a>
    <img src="alum_output.png" style="display: block; width: 20%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>A complete file transfer package for the HP Reverse Polish Lisp
      calculator series, with a modern command-line interface. Alum
      features multiple serial protocols implemented in pure Rust.
    </p>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/mac-plus-serkey"><h3>mac-plus-serkey</h3></a>
    <img src="mac-plus-serkey-metro.jpg" style="display: block; width: 20%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      This is a keyboard emulator for
      the <a href="http://lowendmac.com/1986/mac-plus/">Macintosh
      Plus</a> and earlier models, allowing a modern computer to type
      on the Mac using an Arduino connected over USB. The computer
      captures keystrokes while the Arduino communicates with the Mac
      over its unique keyboard protocol.
