      Hi! I'm Liam Hays, a high school student in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, and this is my website, handcrafted for your viewing
      pleasure in pure HTML and CSS. See below for some of my
      projects, and check out the blog for occasional updates and
      writeups.

      Last updated January 23, 2024. Header is inspired

    <h1>Writing/Documentation/Reverse Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      I
      wrote <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/game-gear-power-docs">a
      complete circuit analysis</a> of the two switching regulators
      inside the Sega Game Gear handheld console in LaTeX. It remains
      the most complete documentation of these regulators and the
      power system inside this console.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have written some basic Sega Game Gear programming tutorials
      using the SMSlib C library,
      available <a href="https://liamhays.github.io/c_gg_lessons/contents/contents.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am the first person in the open-source community to
      investigate the integrated RISC-V microcontroller contained in
      the Rockchip RK3566 SoC, as used in the
      Pine64 <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Quartz64">Quartz64</a>, <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab2">PineTab2</a>,
      and
      the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote">PineNote</a>. <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/rk3566-mcu">My
      research</a> is ongoing and will help provide features to Pine64
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
	I <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/sphero-ble">reverse
	engineered and documented</a> the Bluetooth LE UART protocol
	used by
	the <a href="https://sphero.com/collections/coding-robots/products/sphero-mini">Sphero
	Mini educational robot</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, I wrote
      a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xJqassetCrPjHy9RSIzAp5_YHReIM33seBNZfSYKVo/edit?usp=sharing">brief
      technical description</a> (public Google Doc) of a combined DVD
      player/karaoke machine for the Texas Instruments Electronics
      Online Challenge. The DVD player belonged to a friend, and I
      wrote the document without ever seeing it in person, using only
      pictures of the device's internals. My writeup was voted into
      the top ten out of hundreds of submissions.

    <h1>Contributions</h1>
    <p>
      I have contributed multiple commits and improvements to
	the <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/flipperzero-firmware">official
	firmware repository</a> for
	the <a href="https://flipperzero.one">Flipper Zero</a> hacking
	multitool.

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/flipwire"><h3>Flipwire</h3></a>
    <img src="flipwire.gif" style="margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      The first Flipper Zero Bluetooth software for Windows/Mac/Linux
      computers. Flipwire can transfer files and configure the Flipper
      remotely from a computer, features previously only available on
      the Flipper mobile app.

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/ublox"><h3>u-blox Flipper app</h3></a>
    <img src="flipper_ublox.jpg" style="margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      Flipper Zero app (available on the Flipper app store) for
      displaying data from u-blox GPS modules over I2C. u-blox can
      display data in multiple views, log to KML format, and align the
      Flipper's time to GPS time.

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/quartz64-case"><h3>Quartz64 Model B case</h3></a>
    <img src="quartz_case_front.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      A 3D-printable case for the Quartz64 Model B single-board
      computer designed in FreeCAD. STLs are available for using the
      Quartz with a microSD card or an NVMe drive.
    </p>

    <h1>Older Projects</h1>
    <p>
      These are projects I've done in the past that aren't receiving
      much attention right now, but hopefully are still useful and
      relevant.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/alum"><h3>Alum</h3></a>
    <img src="alum_output.png" style="margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      A complete file transfer package for the HP RPL calculator
      series, with a modern command-line interfaces. Alum is written
      in pure Rust and requires no external dependencies on the host
      computer.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/lamda"><h3>LAMDA</h3></a>
    <img src="lamda/top_view.jpg" style="width: 70%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      LAMDA is a 2-channel 100 kSPS 12-bit data sampling system built
      with an STM32F405 ARM microcontroller board. LAMDA captures
      multiple seconds of data at a time and saves it to an SD card,
      synchronizing samples against a pulse-per-second signal from a
      GPS unit. LAMDA is programmed with the STM32Cube framework.

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/mac-plus-serkey"><h3>mac-plus-serkey</h3></a>
    <img src="mac-plus-serkey-metro.jpg" style="display: block; width: 40%; margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      This is a keyboard emulator for
      the <a href="http://lowendmac.com/1986/mac-plus/">Macintosh
      Plus</a> and earlier models, allowing a modern computer to type
      on the Mac using an Arduino connected over USB. The computer
      captures keystrokes while the Arduino communicates with the Mac
      over its unique keyboard protocol.
    </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/liamhays/tunnel"><h3>Tunnel</h3></a>
    <img src="tunnel.gif" style="margin: auto;"></img>
    <p>
      A small Sega Game Gear game programmed in C with
      the <i>devkitSMS</i> framework. Get your ship to the end of the
      tunnel without hitting the walls or the enemies!
