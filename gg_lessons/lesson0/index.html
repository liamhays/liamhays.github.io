      This is lesson 0, where I introduce these lessons and the
      necessary skills to follow along, and you download what you need
      to get going.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Sega Game Gear programming tutorials. I created
      these because I learned to program for this system the hard
      way---with
      only <a href="https://www.smspower.org/maxim/HowToProgram/">Maxim
      Zhao's short tutorial</a>. While that tutorial teaches important
      components of the Game Gear programming environment, it isn't
      complete. This series of tutorials <i>is</i> complete, from
      Hello World to interactivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the Game Gear (abbreviated GG) is very similar, in
      hardware, to the Sega Master System (SMS). However, the SMS is
      harder to buy in real life and (in my opinion) a less
      interesting console, so I have focused on the GG in these
      tutorials. However, the similarity in hardware means that once
      you can program the GG, you can program the SMS with only a bit
      more knowledge.
    </p>

    <h2>Prerequisite Skills</h2>
    <p>
      Here's the bottom line: if you don't have these skills, you can't
      program for the Game Gear.

      <ul>
	<li>Some programming experience. You don't need to be an
	  incredible coder, but you do need to understand loops,
	  variables, and simple data structures.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of computer numbers. This is <b>so</b> important
	  to programming the Game Gear that I cannot emphasize it
	  enough. Learn bits and bytes, byte order, how bases 2, 10, and
	  16 work, and understand the nibble, and you will have
	  sufficient knowledge. Anything less than this and you will
	  be hopelessly confused---there's no way around it.</li>
	<li>Lastly, you need to be able to use the command line of
	  whatever operating system you're running for simple tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
    <p>
      You need certain software on your computer to program for the
      Game Gear. The main tools are a text editor, an assembler, and
      an emulator (if you own a real GG and a flashcart, you can use
      that instead). I am not going to discuss text editors here, as
      you can use whatever you want; my personal favorite
      is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>
      but you should experiment with different editors and find your
      favorite.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need an <i>assembler</i> to compile your code. Many
      assemblers for the GG's processor exist, but the best one by far
      is
      <a href="https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx">WLA-DX</a>. It is
      only available as source code, so if you want to run the latest
      version, you'll have to compile it yourself. If you're fine with
      running an older version---it's perfectly fine to do so, the
      changes in newer versions are few---you can get Windows and
      macOS (no Apple M1)
      binaries <a href="https://www.smspower.org/Development/WLA-DX">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, to run your code, you will need an emulator unless you
      have real hardware and a flashcart. The easiest emulator to use
      is <a href="https://emulicious.net/">Emulicious</a>, and this
      tutorial will assume that you are using it.
