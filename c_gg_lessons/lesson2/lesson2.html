    <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Lesson 2. In this lesson we'll look at the Game Gear
      hardware in depth. Don't worry if you don't understand every
      single thing in this lesson; you only need a reasonable
      understanding of how this all works.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that if you already know how the GG works, you probably
      don't need to read this section. You may wish to anyway, though,
      as my jargon might be different than what you might use.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Game Gear Hardware</h2>
    
    <img src="gg_system_diagram.png"/>
    <div class="caption">The Game Gear's internal hardware, slightly simplified.</div>
    
    <p>
      As the diagram above shows, the Sega Game Gear is based around a
      Zilog Z80 processor clocked at 3.579545 MHz. The Z80 is
      connected to the cartridge ROM, 8 kilobytes of internal SRAM,
      the Game Gear VDP, the SN76489 PSG, the buttons on the face of
      the console, and some other hardware to control the Gear-to-Gear
      (serial) port and other system hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in the real console, almost all of these components
      are connected to the Z80 via a chip known as the <i>I/O
      controller</i>. However, the I/O controller is transparent to
      the programmer, simply routing signals to the right destination,
      so I won't discuss it here.
    </p>

    <h3>The Game Gear VDP</h3>
    <p>
      The GG VDP (video display processor) is based on the Sega Master
      System VDP, which is in turn based on
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">Texas
      Instruments TMS9918</a>. The TMS9918 has 4 screen modes, and the
      SMS/GG VDP adds a fourth mode called mode 4. While the VDP is
      backwards compatible with the older modes, mode 4 is much more
      powerful than the other modes and so is used exclusively on the
      Game Gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      The GG VDP does not use a <i>bitmap</i>, which is how most
      images on modern computers and game consoles are created. A
      bitmap simply consists of color data for every pixel on the
      screen. As a result, when a bitmap is combined with a
      sufficiently powerful processor, any kind of image can be
      created.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, the GG VDP uses <i>tiles</i>. Tiles are 8x8 pixel
      squares and the VDP can access up to 512 tiles at once. If
      you've got the artistic skill, almost any image can be created
      with enough tiles.
    </p>

    <img src="green_hill_tiles.png"/>

    <div class="caption">
      Every tile is always 8x8 pixels. Green Hill Zone (above) uses
      almost all of the 512 possible tiles. You can see that there's
      some garbage data in the lowest two rows of the image.
    </div>

    <p>
      Tiles and the tilemap are stored in 16 kilobytes of memory known
      as video RAM (VRAM). I call the area of VRAM where tiles are
      stored "tile memory", as there is unfortunately no commonly used
      jargon. As the first diagram shows, this memory is connected to
      only the VDP, and the Z80 can only read and write data to it by
      accessing the VDP.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A tile is also limited in the number of colors it can
      contain. All the colors the VDP ever displays come from a
      special area of memory (actually contained within the VDP
      silicon itself) called the <i>palette</i>. The palette contains
      32 colors, and a tile can access 16 colors from the palette.
    </p>

    <img src="green_hill_palette.png"/>

    <div class="caption">
      Green Hill Zone's 32-color palette. It is split into two
      16-color rows.
    </div>
    
    <p>
      The GG VDP differs in one major way from the Master System VDP:
      it can display 32 out of <b>4096</b> colors. The Master System
      VDP can display 32 out of only 64 colors, and even the workhorse
      Genesis only supports 512 colors (though it can display a
      minimum of 64, and supports more colors with special modes).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it's not enough to give the VDP a set of tiles and a
      palette. To create an image on the screen, the VDP reads a block
      of data called the <i>tilemap</i>, which tells the VDP what
      tiles to place and where to put them on the screen. Tiles can
      only be laid end-to-end; they cannot overlap.
    </p>

    <img src="green_hill_tilemap.png"/>

    <div class="caption">
      The starting tilemap for Green Hill Zone. This is not a perfect
      example for one particular reason we'll discuss later known as
      scrolling---look at the first column of tiles. Also note how the
      whole image is larger than the GG screen. The actually visible
      portion is the thin gray box.
    </div>

    <p>
      There's one more element to discuss. Things on the screen that
      need to move frequently, change state, or are subject to the
      user's input are usually displayed as <i>sprites</i>. Sprites
      are just tiles that can be displayed <b>at any pixel
      location</b> on the screen. Sprites are limited, though, to the
      one half of the 512 tiles, and this half is usually the second
      half. If you look at the picture of the tiles above, you'll see
      that Sonic, the various badniks, the bridges, monitors, and all
      the other objects in the game are stored beneath the thin gray
      line. Beneath that line are the only tiles that sprites can
      access.
    </p>

    <img src="green_hill_sprites.png"/>
    <div class="caption">
      Green Hill Zone doesn't use many sprites. Look at how many
      duplicates there are. Sprites can also change what tile they
      display.
    </div>

    <p>
      Sprites are also the reason that there are 32 colors and not
      16. The second row in the palette are the only colors that
      sprites can reference, so it is called the <i>sprite
      palette</i>. Tiles, when used in the tilemap, can actually
      reference either row in the palette, but usually they just use
      the first row. There isn't a common name for the first row of
      the palette, but in these lessons, I call it the <i>tilemap
      palette</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, the VDP only supports a maximum of 64 sprites, and will
      only display 8 sprites per pixel row. If more than 8 sprites are
      present on one row, then the 9th and up sprite will flicker or
      not be visible.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Hopefully you now have a pretty good understanding of the Game
      Gear video hardware. Let's recap:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tiles are 8x8 pixel squares that reference color entries in
	the palette.</li>
      <li>The palette is 32 colors in the VDP, and the GG supports
	12-bit color.</li>
      <li>Tiles are displayed on the screen using the tilemap, which
	tells the VDP where to put tiles and how to display them.</li>
      <li>Sprites are individual tiles displayed at any pixel
      location. Sprites can only access the second palette, known as
      the sprite palette. The VDP can display up to 64 sprites, with a
	maximum of 8 per pixel row.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drawing an Image</h3>
    <p>
      To draw an image, the VDP pixel by pixel over the screen,
      starting in the upper left corner. This is known
      as <i>scanning</i>. It then reads data from VRAM, iterating over
      the tilemap. Each entry in the tilemap is sequential, and line
      breaks are implied by the fact that the screen image is 256
      pixels wide, or 32 tiles. Each entry encodes information about
      how to display a tile:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The tile number. This number is 9 bits, encoding which one
	of the 512 possible tiles to display.</li>
      <li>Horizontal flip. If horizontal flip is enabled for a tilemap
	entry, that tile will be displayed flipped over the y-axis.</li>
      <li>Vertical flip. If vertical flip is enabled for a tilemap
	entry, that tile will be displayed flipped over the x-axis. This
	can be used together with horizontal flip.</li>
      <li>Palette select. By default, tiles are displayed using the
	tilemap palette, but any tile can also be displayed with the
	sprite palette. This is only useful if the colors in the
	palettes and the tiles are aligned in a useful way.</li>
      <li>Priority. By default, sprites are always displayed on top of
	tiles. If this flag is enabled for a tile in the tilemap,
	sprites will be displayed under this tile instead.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      As the VDP progresses down the screen, it reads the information
      for each entry in the tilemap and displays that tile
      accordingly. At the same time, it processes sprites in a special
      area of VRAM known as the <i>sprite attribute table</i>, or
      SAT. Sprites have far fewer configuration options than the
      tilemap: they have a Cartesian coordinate representing their
      upper left pixel, and what tile index to display. If the VDP's
      current location in the scanning process matches a sprite
      coordinate, and the VDP hasn't overflowed its sprite
      capabilities, it will draw that sprite. (It won't draw it again
      on the next pixel row because the coordinate maps only to the
      upper left of the sprite.)
    </p>
    
    <img src="green_hill_combined.png"/>
    <div class="caption">So when the tilemap, correct palette, and
    sprites are all displayed, we get Sonic in all his glory!</div>

    <p>
      devkitSMS has numerous functions to control the VDP because it's
      such a complicated chip. We'll use them shortly.
    </p>

    <h3>Rest of the Hardware</h3>
    <p>
      Obviously there's more to the Game Gear than just the Z80 and
      the VDP. The most recognizable component is the buttions, which
      are descended from the original Master System controllers.
    </p>

      System's. Credit: <a href="https://segaretro.org">Sega Retro</a>.
    </div>

    <p>
      The GG has a 4-button d-pad, 2 action buttons (creatively named
      "1" and "2"), and a START button. The START button is the only
      divergence from the Master System, and so is accessed
      differently from the other buttons. Luckily, we don't have to
      worry about exactly how any of the buttons are connected to the
      Z80: devkitSMS has functions to find out what keys are pressed.
    </p>

    <h3>ROM and RAM</h3>
    <p>
      The ROM is where compiled code goes, so you as the programmer
      barely have to think about it (devkitSMS applies configuration
      options to SDCC to match the GG hardware). The RAM is where the
      call stack and variables go, and devkitSMS also configures SDCC
      to place data there.
    </p>

    <h3>PSG</h3>
    <p>
      The PSG is the chip responsible for making sound in the
      GG. devkitSMS provides a library called PSGlib to access the
      PSG. We'll do this much later, though.
    </p>

    <h3>Serial</h3>
    <p>
      The EXT connector on the GG allows for communication to another
      GG. devkitSMS does also not support any aspect of this; once
      again, you have to do it yourself with either SDCC's hardware
      access extensions or Z80 assembly language. Also, the EXT port's
      functionality is rarely emulated, so if you're going to use it,
      you should get yourself a flashcart and a real GG.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>
      In this lesson you learned about how the Game Gear's hardware
      works, in particular the VDP. In the next lesson we'll go a
      little deeper and use more advanced features of devkitSMS than
      we have so far.
