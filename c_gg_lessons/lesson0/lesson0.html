    <h1>Lesson 0</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Game Gear programming tutorials! Eventually this
      will be a reasonably complete guide through programming the Game
      Gear (GG) in both C and Z80 assembly.
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <p>
      I explain the software and programming later, but you'll need a
      few prerequisite skills:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Some C experience.</dt>
      <dd>
	You don't need to be a master, but you should be able to
	program in C. If you've programmed the Arduino, that's
	probably enough to get going. For sure, you cannot start
	coding for the Game Gear if you've never programmed before.
      </dd>

      <dt>File/command line skills.</dt>
      <dd>
	We'll be using the command line in the tutorial series. Go
	learn the command line for your operating system if you don't
	already know how to use it.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
						      
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
      In Lesson 0 you'll set up the programming environment. You'll have
      to download a few things to get started.
    </p>
    <h2>The Small Device C Compiler</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="sdcc.sourceforge.net">Small Device C Compiler</a>
      (SDCC) is exactly what it sounds like: a C compiler for small,
      typically quite old, processors. The Game Gear is based around
      the Zilog Z80 processor, so we'll be using the Z80 output from
      SDCC. SDCC has very complex optimization support, because of the
      limited power of old chips, but it is almost completely C
      standards-compliant and has numerous useful features of its
      own. Download the binary for your operating
      system <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/index.php#Download">here</a>
      and install it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're on Windows and you're running the installer, choose
      the "Medium" installation type:
    </p>

    <img src="medium_installation.png"/>

    <p>
      At the end of the installation, make sure "Add &lt;install
      path\bin&gt; to the PATH" box is checked: (if you're on another
      OS, make sure the binary directory is in the appropriate PATH
      variable)
    </p>

    <img src="add_to_install_path.png"/>

    <p>
      Once SDCC is installed, test it: run "sdcc" in a terminal and
      you should get this output:
    </p>

    <img src="sdcc_test.png"/>

    <h2>Text Editor</h2>
    <p>
      Get yourself a good text editor that you're comfortable and
      proficient with. I personally
      like <a href="emacs.org">Emacs</a>, but if you don't already
      have a favorite, try a few and see what you like.
    </p>

    <p>
      This should be a given, but it isn't always: don't use a WYSIWIG
      text editor like Microsoft Word. Get a real, authentic text
      editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or something
      similar.
    </p>

    <h2>devkitSMS</h2>
    <p>
      The last piece of software we need to install
      is <a href="https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS">devkitSMS</a>,
      an SDCC library by sverx that provides numerous useful functions
      for programming the Master System and Game Gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Download
      the <a href="https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">master.zip</a>
      from the repository and extract it somewhere convenient. You'll
      have to access the files when you're compiling your source code,
      so place it in a directory near where you'll be keeping your source.
    </p>

    <h2>Emulicious</h2>
    <p>
      To run your code, you'll need either a real Game Gear with a
      flash cartridge or an emulator. There are many GG emulators
      available, but the one of choice for homebrew development
      is <a href="https://emulicious.net">Emulicious</a>. It is
      very accurate and stable, has many features to show what your
      program's doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Download it and unpack it to a convienent location.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
    <p>
      SDCC should be working, devkitSMS should be somewhere
      accessible, and you should have a text editor up and running by
      now. Move forward onto Lesson 1 to actually start coding.
