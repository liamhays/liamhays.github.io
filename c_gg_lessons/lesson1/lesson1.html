    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Lesson 1. In this lesson we'll be running a small
      Hello World program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code-based lessons are structured simply: first I present
      the particular piece of source code we'll be working with, then
      I break it down and explain each part.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting Up a Directory</h2>
    <p>
      Make a directory somewhere handy. In this tutorial, I'll call
      it <code>helloworld/</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Copy the following files to <code>helloworld/</code> from the
      devkitSMS root
      directory: <code>SMSlib/src/peep-rules.txt</code>, <code>SMSlib/SMSlib_GG.lib</code>,
      <code>crt0/crt0_sms.rel</code>,
      and <code>SMSlib/src/SMSlib.h</code>. If those are all in the
      same directory as the source file, you can run the commands
      below exactly verbatim. If they aren't...then you'll have to
      modify the paths. Then, copy the appropriate binary (or compile
      one yourself) for the <code>ihx2sms</code> program, in
      the <code>devkitSMS/ihx2sms/</code>
      directory. <code>ihx2sms</code> is needed to create the final
      binary for the console.
    </p>
    
      

    <h2>Source</h2>
    <script src="../prism.js"></script>
    <!-- Align it like this so that there's neither indent nor a --
      -- line break -->

    <pre>
<code class="language-C">#define TARGET_GG

#include "SMSlib.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
SMS_EMBED_SEGA_ROM_HEADER(1, 1);
SMS_EMBED_SDSC_HEADER_AUTO_DATE(1, 0, "Liam Hays", "Hello World",
                                "Introduction to SMSlib programming");
	  
void main() {
  SMS_autoSetUpTextRenderer();
  SMS_setNextTileatXY(6,3);
  printf("Hello World");
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      That's all the code you need. Save it as <code>helloworld.c</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Compilation</h2>
    <p>
      Normally when you compile C code, you can do it with one command
      to compile and link at once. SDCC is capable of this, but the
      requirements for the GG mean that we have to compile and link
      separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start by compiling <code>helloworld.c</code>
      to <code>helloworld.rel</code> (<code>.rel</code> is SDCC's
      extension for object files):

      <pre><code class="language-bash">sdcc -c -mz80 --peep-file peep-rules.txt helloworld.c</code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then, link <code>helloworld.rel</code>
      with <code>crt0_sms.rel</code>
      and <code>SMSlib_GG.lib</code>. <code>crt0_sms.rel</code>
      contains necessary code for the Z80, like interrupt vectors,
      and <code>SMSlib_GG.lib</code> contains the compiled code for
      SMSlib:

      <pre><code class="language-bash">sdcc -o helloworld.ihx -mz80 --no-std-crt0 --data-loc 0xC000 crt0_sms.rel helloworld.rel SMSlib_GG.lib</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous command will link all the necessary components
      to <code>helloworld.ihx</code>, and Intel Hex file, a format
      usually used with chip programmers. We need to convert that to a
      normal binary format.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The devkitSMS distribution comes with the <code>ihx2sms</code>
      tool, which converts the <code>.ihx</code> file to a Game Gear
      binary and adjusts the checksum in the ROM for the GG BIOS---not
      all GGs have them, but the ones that do need the ROM to have a
      correct checksum.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, the final command you need to run is:
      
      <pre><code class="language-bash">ihx2sms helloworld.ihx helloworld.gg</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, open Emulicious and load <code>helloworld.gg</code>. You
      should see this:
    </p>

    <h2>Breaking Down the Code</h2>
    <h3>Includes</h3>
    <p>
      Let's start at the top.
    </p>

    <pre>
<code class="language-C">#define TARGET_GG

#include "SMSlib.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>TARGET_GG</code> macro
      configures <code>SMSlib.h</code> to define functions for the
      Game Gear instead of the Master System. While the hardware of
      each system is similar, they aren't identical and SMSlib has to
      accommodate for the differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      We then import <code>SMSlib.h</code>, for the declarations,
      and <code>stdio.h</code> for <code>printf()</code>.
    </p>

    
    <h3>ROM Header</h3>
    <pre>
<code class="language-C">SMS_EMBED_SEGA_ROM_HEADER(1, 1);
SMS_EMBED_SDSC_HEADER_AUTO_DATE(1, 0, "Liam Hays", "Hello World",
                                "Introduction to SMSlib programming");</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      These two macros set some data in special location in the
      resulting ROM file. <code>SMS_EMBED_SEGA_ROM_HEADER</code>
      creates a ROM header, necessary on some versions of the Game
      Gear. The two arguments are the product code and the
      version---set these to whatever you want.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>SMS_EMBED_SDSC_HEADER_AUTO_DATE</code> embeds a <i>SDSC
      header</i>, which contains information relevant to homebrew
      software: major version, minor version, author string, name
      string, and description string. The SDSC header also contains a
      date, but using the <code>AUTO_DATE</code> macro will fill that
      in automatically with today's date.
    </p>

    <h3>main()</h3>
    <pre>
<code class="language-C">void main() {
  SMS_autoSetUpTextRenderer();
  SMS_setNextTileatXY(6,3);
  printf("Hello World");
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>main()</code> function doesn't need to have any return
      value or arguments. It is nothing more than an entry point for
      where the Z80 in the Game Gear should start running code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      devkitSMS comes with numerous useful functions. One of these
      is <code>SMS_autoSetUpTextRenderer()</code>, which configures
      the Game Gear video hardware to display text. If you don't
      already know how that hardware works, don't worry about it;
      we'll cover that in the next lesson. For now, just know that the
      Game Gear is ready to display text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, there's one more step before we can display
      text. The Game Gear always displays an image as large as a TV
      screen, but the internal display only shows a portion of
      that. To make the text visible, we have to set the cursor
      location to 6 characters to the right and 3 characters down from
      the first character on the TV screen, because that's where the
      GG's LCD screen is
      positioned. <code>SMS_setNextTileatXY(6,3)</code> does exactly
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, we can print text. SMSlib configures the Game Gear for
      ASCII text display, so you can print whatever you want. Be aware
      that the <code>printf()</code> included with SDCC is quite
      similar but not identical to ANSI <code>printf()</code> and in
      particular, it does not support floating-point numbers. There's
      more info in
      the <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf">SDCC
      PDF manual</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also note that there isn't line wrapping within the GG
      screen---wrapping will instead occur at the edge of the
      generated TV screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>
      In this lesson, you ran some basic Game Gear code and made the
      console do something. In the next lesson, we'll look at the
      specifics of the hardware and make something a little more
      complicated.
