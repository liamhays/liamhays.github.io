    <h1>Lesson 3</h1>
    <p>
      In the last lesson you learned about the hardware in the Game
      Gear. In this lesson we'll put that knowledge to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, we have run real code on the GG, but it wasn't very
      interesting. All the code did was automatically load a simple
      font into the VDP and print a string. We as the programmer
      barely even had to go anything---devkitSMS took care of
      everything.
    </p>

    <h2>Source</h2>
    <p>
      We've got a few files this time. Start by downloading five
      files: <a href="silver_tiles.c" download>silver_tiles.c</a>,
      <a href="silver_tiles.h" download>silver_tiles.h</a>,
      <a href="silver_palette.h"
      download>silver_palette.h</a>, <a href="silver_tilemap.h"
      download>silver_tilemap.h</a>, and <a href="silver_tilemap.c"
      download>silver_tilemap.c</a>. Place them in a directory, and
      copy or link the necessary files
      (<code>SMSlib_GG.lib</code>, <code>SMSlib.h</code>, etc.) into
      that directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have those, copy and paste this code
      into <code>silver.c</code> in the same directory as just before.
    </p>

    <pre>
<code class="language-C">#define TARGET_GG

#include "SMSlib.h"
#include "silver_tiles.h"
#include "silver_palette.h"
#include "silver_tilemap.h"

SMS_EMBED_SEGA_ROM_HEADER(1, 1);
SMS_EMBED_SDSC_HEADER_AUTO_DATE(1, 0, "Liam Hays", "Silver: Lesson 3",
                                "Silver the Hedgehog on screen");
	  
void main() {
  SMS_loadTiles(silver_tiles, 0, silver_tiles_length);
  SMS_loadTileMapArea(6, 3, silver_tilemap, 10, 20);
  GG_loadBGPalette(silver_palette);
  GG_loadSpritePalette(silver_palette + 32);

  SMS_displayOn();
  while (1);
}</code></pre>


    <p>
      You should now have a total of six source files. To compile, use
      these commands:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-bash">sdcc -c -mz80 --peep-file peep-rules.txt silver_tiles.c

sdcc -c -mz80 --peep-file peep-rules.txt silver_tilemap.c

sdcc -c -mz80 --peep-file peep-rules.txt silver.c

sdcc -o silver.ihx -mz80 --no-std-crt0 --data-loc 0xC000 crt0_sms.rel silver.rel silver_tiles.rel silver_tilemap.rel SMSlib_GG.lib

ihx2sms silver.ihx silver.gg</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is a good time to set up GNU <code>make</code> or a similar
      build system (though something as complicated as CMake probably
      isn't worth it). If you're using <code>make</code>, just put all
      five of those commands under an <code>all:</code> target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once <code>silver.gg</code> has been compiled, open it in
      Emulicious. You should see a familiar face:
    </p>

    <img src="silver_gg.png"/>
    <div class="caption">Silver the Hedgehog, ripped from the
      excellent Genesis ROM hack The S Factor: Sonia & Silver by
      Aquasplash.</div>

    <h2>Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
      This example is actually only a little more complicated than the
      example in Lesson 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      First we include all the data to display on the screen. We'll
      learn more about the correct way to do this in a bit.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-c">#define TARGET_GG

#include "SMSlib.h"
#include "silver_tiles.h"
#include "silver_palette.h"
#include "silver_tilemap.h"</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Then we set up the ROM header and SDSC header.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">SMS_EMBED_SEGA_ROM_HEADER(1, 1);
SMS_EMBED_SDSC_HEADER_AUTO_DATE(1, 0, "Liam Hays", "Silver: Lesson 3",
                                "Silver the Hedgehog on screen");</code></pre>

    <p>
      Once that is complete, we load the tiles that make up Silver,
      the tilemap area to display him, and the tilemap palette, all
      in <code>main()</code>. I'll explain more about these functions
      much later on.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">  SMS_loadTiles(silver_tiles, 0, silver_tiles_length);
  SMS_loadTileMapArea(6, 3, silver_tilemap, 10, 20);
  GG_loadBGPalette(silver_palette);</code></pre>

    <p>
      Finally, we turn on the display and enter an infinite loop. Note
      that "turning on the display" doesn't affect anything on the
      GG's screen hardware; instead, the VDP only generates video
      output when the display is on. The display is off at power-on,
      and when the display is off, we can write data to the VDP and
      VRAM whenever we want. When the display is on, we have to be
      more careful and parsimonious about when we write to the VDP and
      VRAM.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also enter an infinite loop for safety: while it's unlikely,
      it is possible that the Z80 will keep reading data in the
      compiled GG binary and try to use it as code. That could result
      in adverse effects, like corrupting data in VRAM or Z80 RAM.
    </p>
    

    <pre><code class="language-C">  SMS_displayOn();
  while (1);</code></pre>


    <h2>Making the Data</h2>
    <h3>Preparing Silver</h3>
    <p>
      The image of Silver didn't get on screen magically. To convert
      an image to the GG takes a bit of work in any circumstance, but
      luckily there are tools that make it easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started by downloading a sprite sheet of Silver from the page
      on <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/thesfactorsoniaandsilverhack/sheet/98563/">The
      Spriter's Resource</a> for <u>The S Factor</u>. I also used GIMP
      for all the editing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then cropped out the large image of Silver standing, facing
      the camera. If you crop exactly to his bounding box, the
      resulting image is 79x160 pixels. This is clearly not an integer
      multiple of 8x8, so I cropped it to 80x160 pixels.
    </p>

    <img src="silver_spritesheet_cropping.png"/>
    <div class="caption">Cropping Silver out of the sprite sheet. Look
      closely at the right side of the selection rectangle, you can see
      how it's one pixel beyond where it needs to be to fit an 8x8
      multiple rectangle.</div>

    <p>
      I then cropped Silver out and saved him to a new file. In the
      new file, I used GIMP's <u>Color Exchange</u> tool to convert
      the blue background to black. You could convert the blue to any
      other color as well, but it's better to use one that's already
      in use on Silver himself, so that his color fidelity isn't
      reduced. If you used a color for the background not in use on
      Silver, that color would take up a slot in the palette and
      reduce the number of colors used on Silver.
    </p>

    <img src="silver_color_swap.png"/>
    <div class="caption">Converting the blue background to black.</div>
      
    <p>
      We're almost finished modifying the image. Once Silver was
      cropped properly and his background adjusted, I converted the
      image to indexed color. Indexed color means that the image is
      stored with a palette, and each pixel is a reference to a color
      in the palette. We need indexed color because the tool we'll be
      using to convert to the GG tile format only works with indexed
      color PNGs.
    </p>

    <img src="silver_indexed_color.png"/>
    <div class="caption">Converting Silver to indexed color, using 16
      colors.</div>

    <!-- scaled because it's pretty small otherwise -->
    <img src="silver_standing_scaled.png"/>
    <div class="caption"> Since the image already came from a color-limited
      system, the Genesis, converting Silver to GG color did little
      damage. He looks as sleek as ever.</div>
    
    <p>
      Since we're going to be displaying Silver using only the
      tilemap, we have to use only 16 colors when converting to
      indexed color. You should see Silver's appearance change sightly
      after converting; for me his muzzle and arm ring things became
      more yellow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Last step: export the image to a PNG. I used compression level
      5, but it shouldn't really matter. Just make sure you know where
      the file is, since we'll be using a command-line tool to convert
      it.
    </p>

    <h3>Converting to GG Format</h3>
    <p>
      There are other ways to do this, but I believe the best way to
      convert an image to GG tile format is with the
      tool <code><a href="https://github.com/yuv422/png2tile">png2tile</a></code>. <code>png2tile</code>
      takes PNG input and can create tiles, tilemaps, and palettes,
      for both the Master System and Game Gear palette formats, and
      most importantly, can output them in binary files.
    </p>

    <p>
      (digression) Most SMS/GG coding beginners are directed toward
      Maxim
      Zhao's <code><a href="https://github.com/maxim-zhao/bmp2tile">bmp2tile</a></code>. <code>bmp2tile</code>
      supports multiple image formats, compression, and can even
      optimize the tiles to remove duplicates and use
      horizontal/vertical flipping for the tilemap. However, I have
      found it to be buggy (or, at least, I'm not using it right), and
      it's written in C#, so running it on anything besides Windows is
	difficult at best.
    </p>

    <p>
      (digression continues) <code>bmp2tile</code> also only creates
      output useful for assembly programming. For C programming, you
      have to convert that output manually into a C array, and it's
      not really worth the time. <code>png2tile</code> can make binary
      output, which is much more easily converted to C arrays.
    </p>

    <p>
      (digression over) Let's convert Silver to GG data. Go
      get <code>png2tile</code> and compile it. (I will eventually
      host Windows binaries on this site.) Then, run it like this,
      assuming the cropped and indexed image is <code>silver.png</code>:
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">./png2tile silver.png -savetiles silver_tiles.bin -savepalette silver_palette.bin -savetilemap silver_tilemap.bin -pal gg -binary</code></pre>

    <p>
      This will tell <code>png2tile</code> to create tiles, a palette
      in GG color mode, a tilemap, and save it as various files in
      binary format. <code>png2tile</code> needs the input PNG to be a
      8x8 multiple image, hence why <code>silver.png</code> is 80x160.
    </p>

    <h3>Converting to C Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      This is a good opportunity to discuss something important about
      data management for projects like this. <b>DO NOT STORE DATA IN
      HEADER FILES!</b> This guidance was first brought to my
      knowledge when I dabbled in homebrew programming for the Game
      Boy Advance, by J
      Vijn's <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/bitmaps.htm#ssec-data-hdr">guide
      for the <code>tonclib</code> library</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's why: you probably already know that good practice in C
      programming is to never <code>#include</code> anything but
      header files. However, header files are supposed to only contain
      declarations and macros. If you load up a bunch of header files
      with thousands of lines of raw data, then the compiler will
      recompile that data <i>every time you compile your
      project</i>. Even though modern compilers and computers are
      capable enough to handle this, it will still slow down
      compilation and can increase the risk of "multiple declaration"
      errors, which are notoriously hard to fix.
    </p>

    <p>
      This advice rings particularly true for a <code>devkitSMS</code>
      project, because compiling a complete project is done in two
      steps. If data is stored outside of header files, each file can
      be compiled separately and linked together at the end. Assuming
      you have a correctly configured build system, you can take this
      one step farther and only compile the modified files on each
      build. The linker will then link each individual data and code
      object file together and produce the output binary.
    </p>

    <p>
      So here's how you do that. We'll use the actual source files
      that make Silver, in this case, <code>silver_tiles.h</code>
      and <code>silver_tiles.c</code>. <code>silver_tiles.h</code>
      contains the following:
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-C">#pragma once

extern const int silver_tiles_length;
extern const unsigned char silver_tiles[4480];</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      The header file has an <i>include guard</i>, in this
      case, <code>#pragma once</code>. This is also good practice, as
      it prevents a header file from being included at multiple places
      by the preprocessor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each variable is defined as <code>extern
      const</code>. An <code>extern</code> variable means that there
      is another declaration of that variable in a source file,
      and <code>const</code> tells SDCC to place the variable in ROM
      so the Z80's meager 8K of RAM doesn't overflow. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, <code>silver_tiles.c</code> contains this:
    </p>
    
<pre><code class="language-C">#include "silver_tiles.h"

const int silver_tiles_length = 4480;
const unsigned char silver_tiles[4480] = {
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  // ( ... trimmed ... )
};</code></pre>

  <p>
    It is nothing more than the definitions for the two
    variables. However, note that there are no <code>extern</code>s in
    the source file.
  </p>

  <h3>(Actually) Converting to C Arrays</h3>
  <p>
    With that said, let's convert the data to a C array. I am using
    the Linux tool <code>xxd</code>, which can automatically convert binary
    data to a C
    array. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xxd-for-windows/">Here
    is a Windows build</a>, which should be identical in
    functionality. It is a command-line tool in any circumstance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Run <code>xxd</code> with the <code>-i</code> flag, like this, on
    each of the tile, tilemap, and palette binary files:
  </p>
  
<pre><code class="language-bash">xxd -i silver_tiles.bin</code></pre>

  <p>
    <code>xxd</code> will make two variables, one for the array and
    one for the length of the array. It prints out the contents of a
    file to the terminal, so you probably want to use some kind of
    redirection to a file. Create a header file like the example
    above, give the array a length (but keep the length variable,
    we'll need it later), and make the
    variables <code>const</code>. <code>#include</code> the header
    file in your main source file---or wherever it's needed---and make
    sure your compilation process will also compile the matching
    source file for that header file.
  </p>

    <p>
      One more thing worth noting: I did not move the data
      in <code>silver_palette.h</code> into a C source file. It is
      only 32 bytes long, and I am lazy. In a real game or project,
      you would have many different palettes, and you might even want
      to group their declarations together into one header.
    </p>
  <h2>Back to Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    Remember about forty thousand lines ago how I mentioned that I
    would explain those function calls in more depth? Well, here we
    go. First, here's the same functions again.
  </p>

<pre><code class="language-C">  SMS_loadTiles(silver_tiles, 0, silver_tiles_length);
  SMS_loadTileMapArea(6, 3, silver_tilemap, 10, 20);
  GG_loadBGPalette(silver_palette);</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>SMS_loadTiles()</code> is a macro that copies tiles into
      VRAM. It is actually a macro, and it maps to the
      function <code>SMS_VRAMmemcpy()</code>. Fortunately, we don't need
      to know about the latter function, and <code>SMS_loadTiles()</code>
      has a simple syntax:
    </p>

<pre><code class="language-C">SMS_loadTiles(src, tileFrom, size);</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>src</code> is a pointer to the tiles to copy into
      VRAM. <code>tileFrom</code> is the tile index in VRAM to copy
      to. <code>size</code> is the number of tiles to copy. So
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">  SMS_loadTiles(silver_tiles, 0, silver_tiles_length);</code></pre>

    <p>
      will copy <code>silver_tiles_length</code> tiles from the array
      (aka the pointer) <code>silver_tiles</code> into tile index 0 in
      VRAM.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then we load the tilemap into VRAM. The tilemap as generated
      by <code>png2tile</code> can't be directly loaded---if you do
      that, using <code>SMS_loadTileMap()</code>, the result is this
      mess:
    </p>

    <img src="silver_wrong_tilemap.png"/>

    <p>
      Instead, we use the function (actually, it's a macro again that
      just calls a function to copy to
      VRAM) <code>SMS_loadTileMapArea()</code>. It takes five
      arguments: X location to copy to, Y location to copy to, array
      to copy, X dimension of the tilemap area, and Y dimension of the
      tilemap area. So 
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">  SMS_loadTileMapArea(6, 3, silver_tilemap, 10, 20);</code></pre>

    <p>
      will copy the data from <code>silver_tilemap</code> to tilemap
      coordinate (6, 3), and copy a tilemap that is 10 by 20
      tiles. Using this function instead
      of <code>SMS_loadTileMap()</code> will write empty entries in
      the tilemap to make the tilemap fit the area it is supposed
      to. That's why Silver looks right, and not like the mess he does above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we copy the palette to the VDP using the function (not
      a macro this time) <code>GG_loadBGPalette</code>:

    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">  GG_loadBGPalette(silver_palette);</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      This function takes one argument and copies 16 colors from it
      into the tilemap palette. The tilemap is sometimes called
      the <i>background</i>, abbreivated BG, hence the function's
      name.
    </p>

    <h3>Why (6, 3)?</h3>
    <p>
      We're nearing the end of this lesson. There's only one more
      thing to talk about, and I saved it for this lesson instead of
      the last one because it's best understood once you have actually
      manipulated the tilemap.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I mentioned before, the VDP creates an image large enough to
      fill a traditional CRT TV screen. However, the GG LCD screen is
      obviously much smaller than a TV screen, so it only displays a
      portion of the full image. This is best explained by an image,
      actually from Sega's official documentation:
    </p>

    <img src="vdp-02-cropped.bmp"/>
    <div class="caption">What the VDP actually does when it draws one
      frame. Complete with scribblings of some past prospective
      developer.</div>

    <p>
      In that image, what Sega calls "cells" are actually tiles. The
      important thing, though, is the 20x18 tile box labeled "LCD
      display area". Note how it is offset 3 tiles below and 6 tiles
      to the right of the upper left of the original TV screen. This
      box is what the LCD actually shows, and you have to design your
      game or program with that box in mind, while also accounting for
      the fact that the rest of the screen is still virtually
      there. That's why we tell <code>SMS_loadTileMapArea()</code> to
      load a tilemap starting at (6, 3)---otherwise the image will be
      offset incorrectly and might not even be visible.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>
      We did a lot in this lesson. We ran a real project, converted an
      image to GG format, learned good coding practices, discussed
      some actual <code>devkitSMS</code> functions, and learned about
      the GG's LCD and how it connects to the VDP's output.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next lesson, we'll look at more interesting and
      complicated things with tilemaps, start using sprites, and learn
      about how to time a program to the VDP, which is one of the most
      important aspects of programming for the GG.
