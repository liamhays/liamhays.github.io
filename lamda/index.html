    <h1>LAMDA</h1>

    <p>
      LAMDA is a portable data acquisition unit that captures 2 analog
      channels at 12 bits at about 111,000 samples per second per
      channel. It uses
      an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382">Adafruit
      Feather STM32F405 Express</a> and a microSD card. LAMDA also
      synchronizes the recorded data to a pulse-per-second signal
      generated by a GPS unit.
