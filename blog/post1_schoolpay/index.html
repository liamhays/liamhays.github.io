    <h1>The Entities of i3Verticals</h1>

    <p>
      <i>Hey! First post.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I had to purchase an item for the upcoming school
      year. My school district uses
      the <a href="https://schoolpay.com">SchoolPay</a> storefront,
      and for this particular item, it repeatedly crashed or errored
      out at the checkout page. The homepage is more or less what you
      would expect:
    </p>

    <img src="schoolpay_homepage.png">
    
    <p>
      During the purchasing process, I took a little break in case we
      students had all DDoSed the server, and went browsing through
      the links at the bottom of the SchoolPay page. The footer of the
      homepage is fairly simple:
    </p>

    <img src="schoolpay_footer.png">

    <p>
      "Security" creates a little popup window assuring you of
      SchoolPay's security, nothing special:
    </p>

    <img src="security_popup.png">

    <p>
      "Terms of Service" links to
      a <a href="https://schoolpaypdf.s3.amazonaws.com/terms_and_conditions_2019.pdf">AWS-hosted
      PDF file</a>. Good job self-hosting your own legal documents,
      SchoolPay. Notably, the footer of this PDF links
      to <a href="https://mypaynet.com">https://mypaynet.com</a>, the
      payment service that SchoolPay appears to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most interesting, however, is the Privacy Policy link. This
      brings you
      to <a href="https://www.i3verticals.com/privacy-policy/">https://www.i3verticals.com/privacy-policy/</a>.
      This page has clearly barely been updated from the original
      template (see "The Company" in the "Ethics & Compliance"
      section) but the interesting part is the footer:
    </p>
    
    <img src="i3verticals_footer.png">

    <p>
      Wow, that's a lot of banks. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Privacy Policy PDF, on the first page, under section 2,
      they link
      to <a href="https://www.i3verticals.com/wp-content/pdf-library/Entities.pdf">Entities.pdf</a>. This
      is a list of every associated business partner/company/website
      that works with i3Verticals. There are a lot, let's dig in.
    </p>

    <h2>PaySchools</h2>

    <img src="payschools.png">

    <p>
      This
      is <a href="https://payschools.com">https://payschools.com</a>. It's
      strange that i3Verticals would have a competitor to SchoolPay
      with an almost identical name. Their "About Us" page claims that
      PaySchools systems are used by "over 8,000 schools, in 43
      states, and we service over six million students". They also
      advertise systems like "PaySchools Mobile" and the "Pay at
      School System (PASS)". Just average crappy school software.
    </p>

    <h2>EZPay</h2>
    
    <img src="ezpay.png">

    <p>
      The 2000s called, they want
      their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Frutiger
      Aero</a> design language back. (Also, nice carefully-edited-in
      "2023" copyright date). The "Terms and Conditions" link is dead,
      as is "www.866myezpay.com", but the Privacy Policy link takes
      you to the February 2017 edition of the PaySchools Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <img src="ezpay_resource_not_found.png">
    
    <p>
      Impressive. This looks like an old administrative tool for
      EZpay, which appears to not have a actual homepage. If you're
      curious: <a href="https://spsezpayadmintools.com">https://spsezpayadmintools.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Local Level Events</h2>

    <img src="local_level_events.png">

    <p>
      This
      is <a href="https://locallevelevents.com">https://locallevelevents.com</a>. They
      create online ticketing systems for local level
      events. Interestingly, the "About Us" page says that the company
      was created in 2011, and was then bought by i3Verticals in 2015.
    </p>

    <h2>PlacePay</h2>

    <img src="placepay.png">

    <p>
      <a href="https://placepay.org">PlacePay</a> is some long-lost
      McDonald's promotion, but rather a system for residential and
      commercial payments, like rent. Their "About Us" page goes
      straight to a nginx 404 page. Unlike the other companies, this
      one seems to be quite proud of the fact that it's part of
      i3Verticals.
    </p>

    <h2>Axia</h2>

    <img src="axia.png">

    <p>
      Nice. Keep in mind, this is the link that i3Verticals proudly
      placed in the Entities PDF.
    </p>

    <h2>iGovSolutions</h2>

    <img src="igovsolution.png">

    <p>
      <a href="https://igovsolutions.com">iGovSolutions</a> offers
      licensing systems for healthcare, real estate, contractors, and
      the like. That's all.
    </p>

    <h2>Court Solutions</h2>

    <img src="court_solutions.png">

    <p>
      That background is a looping video, where the keys come onto the
      keyboard and start
      typing. <a href="https://courtsolutions.info">Court
      Solutions</a> also advertises their benefits on their front page:
    </p>

    <img src="court_solutions_benefits.png">

    <p>
      Can we not advertise the use of
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">security
      protocol deprecated in 2015</a>? Obviously they mean TLS, but
      still...also, several of the other sites also claim to use SSL
      for security. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, be aware: if you commit a crime that results in a fee, you
      may end up paying some amount to Court Solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Enough</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not writing about every single one of these
      companies. They're all kind of the same thing, either payment
      systems or management solutions or some kind of combination. Put
      simply (I'm skipping over "Corporate", which is just
      i3verticals.com, and "i3 Point of Sale - Hospitality", which is
      the same as the Retail one below):
    </p>

      <dt>Infintech</dt>

      link</a>. However, according
      to <a href="https://i3merchant.com">https://i3merchant.com</a>,
      "Infintech and Axia have joined forces to serve you better."
      </dd>

      <dt>Fairway Payments</dt>
      <dd>Fairway Payments advertises generic "customized digital
	solutions" and strongly recommend you go to the i3Verticals home
	page instead.</dd>

      <dt>Bill & Pay</dt>
      <dd>Bill & Pay is a payment system for small businesses and farmers and the like.</dd>

      <dt>i3Med</dt>
      <dd>iMed, the original company, was acquired by i3Verticals on
	April 30, 2022, according to the homepage. Before that, they made medical software systems.</dd>

      <dt>NET Data / GHS</dt>
      <dd>This company provides more court and law enforcement management software, like billing.</dd>

      <dt>Software Services</dt>

      <dt>mobileAxept</dt>
      <dd>Okay, this one deserves a link just for whatever they're
      doing to the

	offers donation systems for churches.</dd>

      <dt>Kiriworks</dt>
      <dd>Kiriworks is quite old (at least 50 years, apparently) and
	sells buzzwords and healthcare/government software solutions.</dd>

      <dt>Duxware</dt>
      <dd>Duxware offers software for medical practices, like patient management.</dd>

      <dt>Milestone</dt>
      <dd>Milestone offers nothing but services starting with the letter "e" to utility companies.</dd>

      <dd>i3Verticals Healthcare offers medical billing software.</dd>

      <dt>MSi Consulting</dt>

	and "aiCALENDAR".</dd>

      <dt>Pace</dt>

      <dt>Synergistic Systems</dt>
      <dd>This one is actually interesting, we'll look at it in a moment.</dd>

      <dt>ImageSoft</dt>
      <dd>No, it's not the Sony game studio of the 90s. This ImageSoft
      makes systems to make groups like offices, courts, and
      governments go paperless.</dd>

      <dt>Business Information Systems</dt>
      <dd>This company is from Tennessee (like i3Verticals) and seems
      to mostly offer payment and management systems for the state of
	Tennessee. Nothing special.</dd>

      <dt>ACS Medical Business Solutions</dt>
      <dd>Now i3-ACS, this company offers medical billing systems.</dd>

      <dt>OLIS</dt>
      <dd>OLIS, or On-Line Information Services, makes payment and filing systems.</dd>
	
    </dl>

    <h2>SSI</h2>
    <p>
      To start with, SSI
      offers <a href="https://www.getssi.org/alpr-automatic-license-plate-recogn">license
      plate recognition</a>, which appears to be outsourced to
      Vigilant Solutions. On
      their <a href="https://www.getssi.org/products">Solutions</a>
      page, they list some solutions they sell (the brownish texts are
      actually links):
    </p>

    <h3>InterOp Public Safety Suite</h3>
    <img src="interop_pss.png" style="width:40%;">
    
    <p>
      Let's break these down:
    </p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>InterOp CAD</dt>
      <dd>This system is for law enforcement and 911 dispatchers. It
	offers things like call geolocation, and "much, much more...".</dd>
     
      <dt>InterOp RMS</dt>
      <dd>This system is for record management, for everything from
	"Sex Offender Management" to "Social Security Reporting".</dd>

      <dt>InterOp JMS</dt>
      <dd>This system is for jail management, like medical screening,
	money tracking, as well as "inmate movement / activity
	tracking".</dd>

      <dt>InterOp Mobile</dt>
      <dd>InterOp Mobile is software for police officers in cars,
	including "Non-web based User Chat" (makes you wonder how that
	works, and why avoid the web?), the "Fastest E-Ticket solution
	anywhere, period", and "Multi-agency name and vehicle data
	searches". Spyware, in so many words.</dd>

      <dt>InterOp Livescan</dt>
      <dd>This one is interesting. Livescan appears to be a chunk of
	hardware that a police force or similar agency can buy, in the
	format of an arcade cabinet or similar, that captures
	fingerprints specifically for submission to the FBI as well as
	(explicitly mentioned) the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. It
	includes "WebTechnology software, so you won't have to procure
	expensive circuits costing thousands per year." You can kit
	this out with a facial scanner as well as a mental check
	system, for use when issuing firearm permits.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      That's the public safety suite. It appears to be mostly drop-in
      software for law enforcement. However, there's more.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Other Solutions" takes you to this page:
    </p>

    <img src="alpr.png" style="width:40%;">

    <p>
      SSI doesn't actually make license plate recognition
      software. Instead, they
      resell <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/video-security-access-control/license-plate-recognition-camera-systems.html">Vigilant
      Solutions LPR software</a>. According
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Solutions">Wikipedia</a>,
      citing <i>bizjournals.com</i>, Motorola Solutions acquired VaaS
      International Holdings, which owned Vigilant Solutions as a
      subsidiary, for $445 million in January 2019. Motorola Solutions
      also owns many other security companies. I wouldn't be surprised
      if SSI doesn't actually resell Vigilant software anymore, since
      the Motorola acquisition.
    </p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      i3Verticals is a company ("Independent Sales Organization, to be
      exact") of 7 different banks. They own many brands and companies
      that make products for use in the public sector. The range of
      products they make is quite large, and you might be using an
      i3Verticals product all the time without knowing it. Their
      product range is almost humorous, from school payment systems to
      medical records management software to law enforcement spyware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you know all that. I hope you feel enlightened.
