    <h1>Fast Refresh on the Pervasive 2.66" Display</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I have
      a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19219">Pervasive
      Displays 2.66" E-ink development kit</a>, because a family
      member bought one but didn't have a project for it. This display
      is cool because it supports fast refresh, which many
      hobbyist-class e-ink displays don't have. I decided that I
      wanted to connect it (eventually) to my Quartz64 and use it as a
      small terminal emulator, but to do this, I had to figure out how
      to talk to it and make it refresh fast.
    </p>

    <h2>Available Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      My (and most people's) normal process of finding documentation
      on any electronic part is to go to the manufacturer's website
      and see what documentation they provide. Pervasive Displays
      provides a demo UF2 file that runs on the Pi Pico (with fast
      refresh), and several Arduino libraries to interact with the
      screen, but are clearly more interested in taking you on as a
      paid partner. This screen is available in several different
      types
      at <a href="https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/2-66-e-ink-displays">https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/2-66-e-ink-displays</a>. This
      takes you
      to <a href="https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ApplicationNote_Small_Size_Mono_v02_220606.pdf">this
      application note</a>, which describes the SPI interface,
      specific commands for normal and fast refresh, and how to read
      OTP memory in the display driver. Seems useful, right?

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>No! Throw this application note away!</b> Do not use this
      document! It's full of typos and outright incorrect information,
      and most of the information appears to be for other screens or
      outdated or wrong in a hundred ways. Run from this document.
    </p>

    <p>
      It took a while for me to figure this out, but that's why I'm
      writing this blog post. We're going to look at how you
      should <i>actually</i> interface with this screen. I took
      information
      from <a href="https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_EXT3_Basic">the
      normal Arduino library</a>,
      the <a href="https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/PDLS_EXT3_Basic_Fast">the
      fast update (except it isn't really) Arduino library</a>, and
      the <a href="https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/epd-pico-kit-epdk/">demo
	UF2</a> file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ultimate goal of my reverse engineering here is to drive
      this display with my Quartz64 board, probably to make a very
      small terminal emulator. I'll describe that project in a future
      post, and I'll link to the code that shows how to drive the
      screen from Rust using <code>spidev</code>
      and <code>gpio_cdev</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>SPI Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Most small e-ink screens use an internal display driver and a
      serial interface, and this one is no exception. The panel
      requires a high voltage charge pump, provided by the PCB that
      comes with the kit, which also breaks out 2 (not 3! Check the
      pinout
      in <a href="https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1P257-00_04_E2266CS0C1-E2266CS0C2_20211129.pdf">the
      datasheet</a>) SPI pins, a chip select (/CS) pin, a D/C pin, a
      RESET pin, and a BUSY status pin. The panel is rated for 3.3V
      logic and power (the datasheet is seems mostly correct, unlike
      the appnote). The EXT3 board that comes with the kit also
      includes a SPI flash chip (what's on it). Pervasive calls the
      display driver the "chip on glass", or just "CoG".
    </p>

    <p>
      Use SPI mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0) and MSB first. I don't know
      the maximum SPI speed, but it's probably around 10 MHz. The
      Arduino libraries use 4 MHz, and I've had success driving it at
      8 MHz.
    </p>

    <p>
      The display uses SPI but differentiates between data and command
      writes by the D/C pin: low for command, high for data. A command
      is an 8-bit register to write to, and data can be any length.
    </p>

    <p>To write to a register:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Activate the chip.</b></li>
      <p>
	Pull D/C and /CS low to select the CoG and put it in command mode.
      </p>

      <li><b>Write the register.</b></li>
      <p>
	With your platform's SPI system, write one byte (the register
	you want to write to) to the SPI port.
      </p>

      <li><b>Put the chip into data mode.</b></li>
      <p>
	Pull /CS high briefly (1 microsecond is enough) and pull D/C
	high to start sending data. Then, pull /CS low again and send
	all the data.
      </p>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If needed, deselect the chip afterward. Example Pico SDK code
      for this (the microsecond sleeps are probably optional):
    </p>
    
    <pre><code class="language-C">void pervasive_266_write_register(uint8_t reg, uint8_t* data, uint32_t data_len) {
    // pull D/C and display panel CS low
    gpio_put(PIN_DC, 0);
    gpio_put(PIN_PANEL_CS, 0);
	
    sleep_us(50);
    
    spi_write_blocking(SPI_PORT, &amp;reg, 1); // write register ID
	
    sleep_us(50);

    // pull high/low to deselect and reselect the panel and to write data
    gpio_put(PIN_PANEL_CS, 1);
    gpio_put(PIN_DC, 1); // pull D/C high to send data
    sleep_us(1);
    gpio_put(PIN_PANEL_CS, 0);
    
    sleep_us(50);

    // write all data
    spi_write_blocking(SPI_PORT, data, data_len);
    
    sleep_us(50);

    // deselect panel
    gpio_put(PIN_PANEL_CS, 1);
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Image data format</h2>
    <p>
      Image data is stored as 1bpp color, formatted in rows. The most
      significant bit corresponds to the leftmost pixel in a row.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The screen is oriented such that when the flex cable "tail" is
      pointing downward, the origin is in the upper left corner of the
      display. This means that, on the 2.66" screen, each row is 152
      pixels, and there are 296 rows. One frame of data on this screen
      is 5624 bytes.
    </p>

    <h2>Normal Display Updates</h2>
    
    <p>
      A normal update of the display refreshes the whole screen
      several times (to erase the afterimage), then draws the desired
      image on the screen. All the work is done by the chip in the
      display, called the "CoG", or "chip on glass".
    </p>

    <p>
      The list below describes how to drive both the special pins and
      what data to write on the SPI bus. Most operations are done
      through SPI. To issue a normal refresh to the screen:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Hard reset the CoG.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> none
      <p>
	Assert RESET high for 5 ms, then low for 10 ms, then high for
	5 ms again, then put /CS high and wait 5 ms.
      </p>

      <li><b>Soft reset the CoG.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x0e</code> to register <code>0x00</code>
      <p>
	The soft reset is always required, regardless of display mode,
	while the hard reset is only required for a complete
	update and before the first fast update.
      </p>

      <li><b>Set the temperature.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write the surrounding temperature in Celsius (one byte) to register <code>0xe5</code>.
      <p>
	The CoG needs to know the surrounding air temperature in
	Celsius. This adjusts the refresh speed, presumably to
	compensate for changes the e-ink material's properties at
	various temperatures.
      </p>

      <li><b>Activate this temperature value.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x02</code> to register <code>0xe0</code>.
      <p>
	I don't know the exact purpose of this command, but I suspect
	that it tells the CoG that the temperature you just supplied
	is what it should actually use.
      </p>

      <li><b>Set PSR.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0xcf, 0x8d</code> to register <code>0x00</code>.
      <p>
	I don't know what PSR actually stands for (maybe "panel
	settings register"?), but it's referenced in both the evil
	application note and the Arduino library and you have to set
	it.
      </p>

      <li><b>Write image data.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write the new image to
      register <code>0x10</code> and 5642 bytes of anything to
      register <code>0x13</code>.
      <p>
	For a normal update, the CoG only needs one image but two
	register writes. <b>You must write to both registers!</b> The
	CoG will simply ignore whatever data you write
	to <code>0x13</code>.
      </p>

      <li><b>Refresh the panel.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Select register <code>0x04</code>, wait,
      select register <code>0x12</code>, wait, select
      register <code>0x02</code>, wait.
      <p>
	You don't have to write any actual data to the registers in
	this section, you just have to "select" the register by
	writing it over SPI while D/C is low. The CoG doesn't care if
	you write data, so I just write <code>0x00</code> to these
	registers.
      </p>
      <p>
	<code>0x04</code> turns on the DC/DC
	converter, <code>0x12</code> refreshes the display (this is by
	far the longest step), and <code>0x02</code> turns off the
	DC/DC converter. <b>Between each write, poll the BUSY pin and
	wait for it to go high.</b>
	
      </p>
    </ol>

    <p>
      That's all you have to do for a normal update! The display will
      flash to clear the old image and then display the new image you
      provided.
    </p>

    <h2>Fast Refreshes</h2>
    <p>
      Technically, there are two kinds of fast refreshes. The first
      one is fairly slow and is described (inaccurately, of course) in
      the application note. It's only available with the Arduino
      library, and has this odd behavior where it will flash the new
      pixels like a full refresh, but <i>only</i> the new pixels. Each
      fast refresh in this mode takes about 3 seconds, and it has
      problems with ghosting or even making pixels visible if the
      background is dark.
    </p>

    <p>
      The faster kind of fast refresh is what we're accustomed to with
      e-ink panels like a Kindle, Boox, PineNote, and all the rest. It
      simply moves the new pixels with one charge cycle, so you get
      ghosting, but it's fast. I haven't timed these refreshes yet,
      but I think they take about 300-500 ms. Pervasive claims 300 ms
      fast refreshes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The slow fast refresh is the only kind available with the free
      Arduino library. The demo UF2, which uses Pervasive's full
      library suite that you have to pay for, uses fast refresh. As
      such, I'm not here to nab any features of the full suite other
      than fast refresh. GUI rendering, shape primitives, text, and
      everything else you need for a screen like this is still up to
      you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I uploaded the demo UF2 to the Pi Pico that came in the kit,
      hooked it up to my logic analyzer, and captured the command
      sequence that makes fast refresh work.
    </p>

    <h2>Fast Refresh Updates</h2>
    <p>
      Real fast refreshes are similar to normal updates, but with more
      initial configuration before the image data. The list below
      shows the SPI transaction again but doesn't describe operations
      shared with the normal refresh cycle.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><b>Hard reset the CoG.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> none.
      <p>
	<b>You only have to do this once</b>, but it must be done
	before all fast refreshes.
      </p>

      <li><b>Soft reset the CoG.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x0e</code> to register <code>0x00</code>

      <p></p>
      
      <li><b>Set the temperature.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write the surrounding temperature in Celsius (one byte) to register <code>0xe5</code>.

      <p></p>
      
      <li><b>Activate the temperature.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x02</code> to register <code>0xe0</code>.

      <p></p>
      
      <li><b>Set the PSR.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0xcf, 0x8d</code> to register <code>0x00</code>.
      <p></p>
      
      <li><b>Set the PSR again.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0xff, 0x8f</code> to register <code>0x00</code>.
      <p>
	You have to send more data to the same register. I assume this is part of PSR, but I don't really know.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Set "Vcom and data interval setting".</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x07</code> to register <code>0x50</code>.
      <p>
	This is a number described in the application note and the
	Arduino library, so I'm willing to believe that this is the
	correct name. 
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Write to some other registers.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write <code>0x0c</code>
	to register <code>0x30</code>, then write <code>0x11</code>
      to register <code>0x82</code>.
      
      <p>
	I don't know what these do. 
      </p>

      <li><b>Write strings of data to some more registers.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Write <code>0x01,0x00,0x05,0x05,0x01,0x09,0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>
	  to <code>0x20</code>.</li>
	<li>Write <code>0x01,0x55,0x05,0x05,0x01,0x09,0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>
	  to <code>0x23</code>.</li>
	<li>Write <code>0x01,0xAA,0x05,0x05,0x01,0x09,0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>
	  to <code>0x22</code>.</li>
	<li>Write <code>0x01,0x02,0x05,0x05,0x01,0x09,0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>
	  to <code>0x21</code>.</li>
	<li>Write <code>0x01,0x01,0x05,0x05,0x01,0x09,0x01,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00</code>
	  to <code>0x24</code>.</li>
	  
      </ul>
      <p>
	These are long strings of data that have to be written to
	certain registers. Again, I have no idea what they do, but
	they enable true fast refresh. Each string is 16 bytes long.
      </p>

      <li><b>Write the old and new images.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Write the old image to
      register <code>0x10</code> and the new image of anything to
      register <code>0x13</code>.
      
      <p>
	The CoG uses both images to figure out which pixels need their
	state changed, through some kind of image operation
	(subtraction, maybe?).
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Refresh the panel.</b></li>
      <b>SPI transaction:</b> Select register <code>0x04</code>, wait,
      select register <code>0x12</code>, wait, select
      register <code>0x02</code>, wait.
      <p>
	Enable the DC/DC converter, wait for BUSY to go high, refresh
	the panel, wait for BUSY, then optionally turn the DC/DC
	converter back off, and wait for BUSY. The demo UF2 doesn't
	turn it off---maybe to reduce wear?
      </p>
      
    </ol>

    <p>
      That's it! The display will run a fast refresh cycle and change
      only the pixels that have been changed between the two images.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Usage</h2>
    <p>
      I'm working on a simple terminal emulator (not a modesetting
      driver, though I might do that later) in Rust that will display
      on the e-ink screen. I'll make a post about this soon, and I'll
      probably add images to this post at the same time.
