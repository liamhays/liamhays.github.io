    <h1>Optimizing BL808 Interrupts</h1>
    <p>
      I recently got a
      Pine64 <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Ox64">Ox64</a>, a
      fast but confusing microcontroller board in the form factor of a
      Pi Pico. Because it's so fast, I wanted to see how quickly I
      could get it to respond to a GPIO interrupt.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chip has 3 RISC-V cores, but only 2 that we need to worry
      about. The first is named "d0", and is a RV64IMAFCV core that
      runs at 480 MHz. However, it's only useful for selected tasks,
      because it doesn't connect to the full range of on-chip
      interrupts or on-chip memories. The second core is named "m0"
      and is a RV32IMAFCP CPU at 320 MHz, and has more peripheral
      connections than d0. (Basically, d0 is intended for multimedia
      processing, while m0 is intended for controlling the wireless
      features and the on-chip peripherals.)
    </p>

    <p>
      This means is that you have to use the slightly slower,
      32-bit-only core for GPIO interaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      A common way to measure interrupt response time on
      microcontrollers is to cycle an output GPIO pin at fairly high
      speed, connect it to an interrupt input pin, then have the
      interrupt service routine set a third pin high. Then, if you
      monitor the first pin and the third pin on an oscilloscope, you
      can measure the amount of time the microcontroller took to
      process the interrupt.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Environment and Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      I downloaded
      the <a href="https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk">Bouffalo
      SDK</a> and set it up with
      the <a href="https://bl-mcu-sdk.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/get_started/get_started.html">configuration
      instructions</a> (these are only in Chinese, but translate
      well). I used the version from Git hash <code>cf71fcf</code>,
      which was HEAD at the time I cloned the repo.
    </p>

    <p>
      The BL808 downloads code over UART, but Bouffalo somehow made a
      chip that isn't compatible with just every standard UART
      adapter. In particular, the FT232RL does not work. I used a
      Pi Pico with the firmware linked on the Ox64 wiki page.
    </p>

    <h2>Attempt 1</h2>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>
      There's no "create new project" command in the Bouffalo SDK, so
      I copied the "helloworld" example to another directory and used
      that as my project. Since we're only using the m0 core, I edited the Makefile to be:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-makefile">SDK_DEMO_PATH ?= .
BL_SDK_BASE ?= &lt;SDK base path&gt;

export BL_SDK_BASE

CHIP ?= bl808
BOARD ?= bl808dk
CPU_ID ?= m0
CROSS_COMPILE ?= riscv64-unknown-elf-

# add custom cmake definition
#cmake_definition+=-Dxxx=sss

include $(BL_SDK_BASE)/project.build</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is just the default Makefile, slightly modified. Note
      the <code>CHIP</code>, <code>BOARD</code>,
      and <code>CPU_ID</code> definitions, which save me from having
      to put these variables on the command line every time I
      run <code>make</code>. (For the record, the Ox64 isn't exactly
      the same as "<code>bl808dk</code>", but it's close enough for
      this).
    </p>

    <p>
      I then made a simple <code>main.c</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

#include "bflb_mtimer.h"
#include "bflb_gpio.h"
#include "board.h"

#define GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN (GPIO_PIN_26)
#define GPIO_SOURCE_PIN (GPIO_PIN_27)
#define GPIO_OUTPUT_PIN (GPIO_PIN_24)

struct bflb_device_s* gpio;

void read_mem_isr(int irq, void* arg) {
    bflb_gpio_set(gpio, GPIO_OUTPUT_PIN);
    bflb_gpio_int_clear(gpio, GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN);
}

int main() {
    board_init();

    gpio = bflb_device_get_by_name("gpio");
    bflb_gpio_int_init(gpio, GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN, GPIO_INT_TRIG_MODE_SYNC_RISING_EDGE);
    bflb_gpio_int_mask(gpio, GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN, false); // false means enable
    
    bflb_gpio_init(gpio, GPIO_SOURCE_PIN, GPIO_OUTPUT | GPIO_PULLUP | GPIO_SMT_EN | GPIO_DRV_0);

    bflb_gpio_init(gpio, GPIO_OUTPUT_PIN, GPIO_OUTPUT | GPIO_PULLUP | GPIO_SMT_EN | GPIO_DRV_0);
    
    bflb_irq_attach(gpio->irq_num, read_mem_isr, gpio);
    bflb_irq_enable(gpio->irq_num);

    while (1) {
        bflb_gpio_set(gpio, GPIO_SOURCE_PIN); // trigger the interrupt (source is wired to trigger)
        bflb_mtimer_delay_ms(1);
        // reset both pins
        bflb_gpio_reset(gpio, GPIO_SOURCE_PIN);
        bflb_gpio_reset(gpio, GPIO_OUTPUT_PIN);
        bflb_mtimer_delay_ms(1);
    }
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>GPIO_SOURCE_PIN</code> is the pin that goes high
      periodically, <code>GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN</code> is the pin that
      receives the interrupt, and <code>GPIO_OUTPUT_PIN</code> is the
      pin that gets set high by the interrupt handler. We're just
      using Bouffalo SDK functions for the first attempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compile, just run <code>make</code> in the project
      directory. To flash, run <code>make flash COMX=&lt;your serial
      port&gt;</code>. Because the Makefile defines the chip, board, and
      CPU ID, we don't need to specify these on the command line.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <img src="m0_sync_interrupt.png" style="margin: auto;">

    <p>
      This is, quite simply, terrible. I wouldn't even expect 37
      microseconds from a 20-year-old chip, let alone a 2ish-year old
      one. This image is a screenshot from my oscilloscope software,
      and the time at the bottom of the picture is the delta between
      the left and right white dashed lines. What you can't see in
      this picture is that the yellow rising edge jumped around a lot,
      and was on average closer to 45 microseconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something's clearly wrong, let's try again.
    </p>

    <h2>Attempt 2</h2>
    <p>
      Did you catch the problem in the code for the first attempt?
      Look at the interrupt configuration again:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-C">bflb_gpio_int_init(gpio, GPIO_INTERRUPT_PIN, GPIO_INT_TRIG_MODE_SYNC_RISING_EDGE);</code></pre>

    <p>
      The BL808 reference manual defines a total of 8 types of GPIO
      interrupts, but we're interested in only the rising edge ones.
    </p>

    <!-- not sure why but making the width 100% causes the image to autofit the right width. -->
    <img src="sync_rising_edge.png" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;">

    <img src="async_rising_edge.png" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;">

    <p>
      The synchronous interrupt
      (<code>GPIO_INT_TRIG_MODE_SYNC_RISING_EDGE</code>) will sync the
      interrupt to a 32 kHz clock, which explains both the delay (1
      cycle at 32 kHz = 31 microseconds) and the jitter (the time
      between the rising edge and the next edge of the clock will
      vary). The asynchronous interrupt will forward the interrupt as
      fast as possible, without waiting for a clock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what I got when I changed the interrupt to async
      (<code>GPIO_INT_TRIG_MODE_ASYNC_RISING_EDGE</code>):
    </p>

    <h3>Result</h3>

    <img src="m0_async_interrupt.png" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;">

    <p>
      596 nanoseconds. This is much, much better and far closer to
      what I would expect for a 320 MHz processor. There's also no
      more jitter, because there's no sync clock and probably also
      because the CPU's cache has kicked in.
    </p>

    <h2>Attempt 3</h2>
    <p>
      Even though this is much better than my first attempt, I still
      figured I could do better. One way to improve speed on every
      microcontroller is to bypass whatever SDK libraries are in
      use. On basically all platforms, there is at least one layer of
      indirection between the interrupt vector and the actual
      interrupt service routine, plus, using functions
      like <code>bflb_gpio_set()</code> adds overhead because of the
      function call and any error checks, if implemented. I decided to
      modify the lowest level interrupt handler to set the pin high as
      fast as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Microcontroller SDKs usually provide basic startup and vector
      table code to be compiled into your project. For the m0 core on
      the BL808, these are stored in the Bouffalo SDK directory,
      at <code>drivers/soc/bl808/std/startup/m0</code>. We want the
      file <code>vector.S</code>, which has the RISC-V assembly code
      for the function <code>default_interrupt_handler</code>. This
      function is called by the RISC-V core itself when an interrupt
      occurs, and saves registers before jumping to the SDK interrupt
      handler.
    </p>

    <p>
      With 3 lines of assembly, we can make this function set the
      output GPIO pin high and optimize the interrupt response as much
      as possible. Place these three lines just beneath the <code>default_interrupt_handler:</code> label:
    </p>

    <pre><code>li   t0, 0x20000aec // location of register gpio_cfg138
li   t1, 0x1000000 // set pin 24 high
sw   t1, 0(t0)</code></pre>	

    <p>
      (My <a href="https://prismjs.com">syntax highlighter</a> doesn't
      have a RISC-V assembly mode!) This code loads the address of
      the <code>gpio_cfg138</code> register into temporary register 0
      and the number <code>0x1000000</code> into temporary register 1,
      then writes the contents of t1 to the memory location in
      t0. <code>gpio_cfg138</code> is a set/reset register on the
      BL808 GPIO, so setting bits in this register causes GPIO pins to
      go high and clearing bits causes pins to go
      low. <code>0x1000000</code> is equal to <code>1 &lt;&lt;
      24</code>, which, when written to <code>gpio_cfg138</code>, will
      make GPIO 24 go high.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not modify the interrupt service routine, because we still
      need to clear the interrupt
      with <code>bflb_gpio_int_clear()</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <img src="m0_async_interrupt_assembly.png" style="margin:auto;">

    <p>
      152 nanoseconds. The timing for this attempt was as stable as
      attempt 2.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion and Comparison</h2>
    <p>
      There you have it. Like usual, if you get your hands dirty in
      assembly, you can make the computer go really fast.
    </p>

    <h3>BL808 vs. STM32F405</h3>
    <p>
      I did this same interrupt speed test a while ago on an STM32F405
      Feather running at full speed (168 MHz) under the Cube
      framework. The fastest I got this chip to respond was 172 ns:
    </p>

    <img src="f405_bsrr_set_interrupt_latency.png" style="margin:auto;">

    <p>
      I didn't even have to go into assembly to get this. The
      STM32Cube framework provides for a versatile interrupt handler,
      but you can also edit the actual interrupt vector function in C
      (no assembly required!). I just added a write to the GPIO
      set/reset register at the start of the interrupt vector function
      to get this speed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I think that the BL808 could respond faster than what I got. The
      m0 core is almost twice as fast as the STM32F405 but is only a
      little bit faster at responding to interrupts. There are many
      factors that could cause this: caching, peripheral bus speeds,
      and the time it takes a specific CPU to respond to an interrupt,
      to name a few. Hopefully documentation improves for the BL808
      and and I'll be able to create a more definitive description of
      the chip configuration for this experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope you enjoyed this exploratory writeup. I'll try to update
      this post if I get any more cool microcontroller boards.
