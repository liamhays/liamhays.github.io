    <h1>Denon DRA-900H</h1>
    <p>
      Christmas 2023 was good to me and brought a Denon DRA-900H
      stereo receiver to replace a 25-year-old Onkyo that worked,
      technically. The Denon brings with it several cool features,
      including six HDMI inputs including ARC, Bluetooth, TOSLINK
      input for the CD player, a remote control that actually
      functions, and the star of today's show: AirPlay.
    </p>

    <p>
      To play audio wirelessly to the Onkyo from another device, it
      was connected to a Pi 3
      running <a href="https://libreelec.tv/">LibreELEC</a> and
      configured to also act as a Bluetooth sound receiver. This
      worked perfectly from my phone, but my computer was unable to
      play more than about 5 seconds of audio over Bluetooth without
      stuttering and popping, and eventually I gave up trying to find
      the cause. (I still theorize it might be something to do with my
      Intel Wireless 7265 card's integrated Bluetooth, which also has
      issues in LE mode that other cards don't exhibit, but I don't
      have any real evidence to support this. I also seem to recall
      the problem happening on the Qualcomm QCA6174 that my computer
      came with.)
    </p>

    <p>
      When I realized that the Denon supported AirPlay, I immediately
      tried to use it from my computer. With PipeWire, setting up
      AirPlay is as simple as configuring Avahi (and/or firewall
      configuration as needed), then running <code>pactl load-module
      module-raop-discover</code>. PipeWire will discover the AirPlay
      sink advertised by the Denon and it will appear as a global
      audio sink. I use Plasma, so I open the Plasma audio popup and
      set the audio output to the Denon.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first got the Denon, I tried to play to it via AirPlay
      but no sound came out. With a lot of digging, I
      found <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/3698">this
      PipeWire bug report</a> which links to some code changes that
      add latency values if an AirPlay sink doesn't report latency on
      its own. This change hadn't been merged into a PipeWire release,
      so I tested the main branch on my Quartz64...and it worked!
      Audio came through loud and clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the fix in sight, I waited for the next PipeWire release,
      which turned out to be version 1.0. Unfortunately, it still
      didn't work on my main laptop, so I put the problem aside for a
      bit, until the most recent release (1.0.2-1 in the Arch
      repos). PipeWire could discover the Denon, it would appear as a
      sink, but once again, no audio would play.
    </p>

    <p>
      After some more sleuthing, I found that the Denon was trying to
      send some kind of data back to the computer over UDP port
      6002. I keep ufw running with all incoming connections denied
      except for specific rules, and after adding an ALLOW IN rule for
      UDP 6002, the Denon made sound!
    </p>

    <p>
      The only issue left is that playing audio via VLC
      sounds <i>terrible</i>. It stutters, it cuts out, and it sounds
      kind of like it's being resampled very poorly. I don't know why
      this happens, but Firefox and mpg123, so that's enough for me.
